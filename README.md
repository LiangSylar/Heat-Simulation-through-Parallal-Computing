# Heat-Simulation-through-Parallal-Computing
Heat Simulation, also known as Thermal Simulation, refers to the simulation of the 
process of heat transfer, including how the distribution of heat on a specific piece of material, 
or that of a room, changes with time. 

In recent times, a number of modeling and simulation measures have been applied to the 
analysis of heat transfer. There are various mechanisms of heat transfer, including heat 
conduction, convection, thermal radiation, and transfer of energy with phase changes. In 
spite of all the glamorous techniques and the complex classifications of heat transfer, this 
repository focuses on a rather simple simulation of heat conduction confined to a two-dimensional room with walls (Figure 1). Five programs (one sequantial and four parallel) have been written for the purpose to visualize the heat simulation process. Several factors will have an impact on the performance of these programs, typically includes the input size and the number of processors in parallel computing.
